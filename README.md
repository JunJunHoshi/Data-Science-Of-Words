# Data-Science-Of-Words
This is the report for my language data processing calss at Keio University.
I am interented in the difference between the vocabulary used in the kid books and classical books.
I corrected 60 books and more than 10,000 words in sum and made the "Vocabulary list for child" and "Vocabulary list for adult".
The former's words are mainly used by kid books frequently but not adult. The latter's words are used mainly by classical books for adult but not child.
I hope you observe the difference between them, as you have interensted in it or feel to want to ask me somethihng, you can contact me easily.
If I have enough time, I will start this processeing again by the script of CNN Students News and That of New York Times, to observe the difference between them.
